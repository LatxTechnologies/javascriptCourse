Introduction To Arrow

let student1 = "Ajay"
let student2 = "kajal"
let setudent3 = "Mukul"

let students = ["Ajay", "Mukul", "kajal", "neha", "Ashish"]



Task 
1. Methods in array

push() - insert element at the end of the array
unshift() - insert new element at beggining
pop() - Remove last element
shift() - remove first element
indexOf(3) - if true return index else -1
include(3) - if true then return true else false 


concatenate 

let arr1 = [1,2]
undefined
let arr2 = [3,4]
undefined
let arr3 = arr1 + arr2
undefined
arr3
'1,23,4'
let arr4 = arr1.concat(arr2)
undefined
arr4
(4)Â [1, 2, 3, 4]


object
it same as a array but difference is that there is a key:value pair

let student = {
   name : "Joelin",
   course : "Web Development",
   Friends : ["Kajal","Mohit"]
}

array of object

[
   {
      name : "Joelin",
      course : "Web Development",
      Friends : ["Kajal","Mohit"]
   },
   {
      name : "Senchi",
      course : "Web Designing",
      Friends : ["Shivani","Rohit"]
   },
   {
      name : "Mukul",
      course : "C Programming",
